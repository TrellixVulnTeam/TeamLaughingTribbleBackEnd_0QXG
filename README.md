# TeamLaughingTribbleBackEnd <br />
Note that in repo Backend.zip or : https://github.com/jennifernghi/TeamLaughingTribbleBackEnd is our planned backend repo. However, up until this point, we only focus on firebase authentication and CRUD in the front end project. So, this project is just a environment setup so far.

To use the ParkHere Android Application, you do not need to set up a backend service. We used the Google Cloud Platform + Firebase to handle the backbone of our infrastructure. Doing so allowed us to focus on building the Android application rather than focusing on server set up & maintenance and creating an API to handle requests from the clients. Since Firebase handles client-server communication and queries on the Database, our backend is primarily the environment with the Realtime Database.

The Firebase Android API provides queries CRUD operations on the Realtime Database from the Android Application. The Google Cloud platform allows us to extend commonly used services such as: User Authentication, NoSQL Database, Notifications, Cloud File Storage, and Cloud Testing. 

To view the backend/database live:
Log into https://parkherefirebasebackend-94efb.firebaseio.com/
You can log into the FireBase console with our team gmail account.
username: laughingtribble@gmail.com
pass: laughingtribbleteam
The view should be the root of the database.
Click on any node to expand it and view the information it contains.
Done.
